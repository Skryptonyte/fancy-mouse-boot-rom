# Fancy Mouse Boot ROM

This boot rom will allow you to load a 1.0 Xbox BIOS. This boot rom contains
absolutely no code copyrighted by Microsoft, so you are free to distribute it.

## Legalities

We aren't an expert on law. However, there are a few things to note:

- Decryption keys are not copyrightable. They are random numbers generated by a
  computer - NOT a form of creativity or expression.

- Also, the ARCFOUR algorithm is not an algorithm protected by trade secrets,
  having been published by RSA Security years before this was made, not that it
  would have mattered since Microsoft does not own the algorithm and thus cannot
  copyright it.

- We have not agreed to any contractual agreement that states we cannot do this,
  and you probably have not agreed to any contractual agreement that states you
  cannot use this. So go ahead and use this.
